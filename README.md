# Ecommerce-Application
Web application is designed to sell the products and allow the people to choose from different brands. 
It allows you to browse though the products, add them to the cart and checkout the items.
Here to design this application used Php, Html5, CSS, and used MySql to store the data related to the
products, brands, categories and customers.

I have created the admin folder, where i have all the functions in php to add the products into the website 
i had also created a separate form, where i will add all the products and select the images from my directrory 
location in the system, which will also store the data in to the database where i have a product table. 
Similary i have aslo create Category and Brand tables to keep products of diffrent brands.
